Thanks for stopping by! I'm a PhD Student in the Mechanical Engineering Department and <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/Herrick" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Herrick Laboratories</a> at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Purdue University</a>, working under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://kevinjkircher.com/" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Kevin Kircher</a>. My research centers on developing machine learning, optimization, and control algorithms for heating and cooling systems in commercial buildings.

I recently achieved my Masterâ€™s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the School of Engineering at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">University of British Columbia</a> in Canada, where I was supervised by Prof. <a href="https://engineering.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/sunny-ri-li/" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Sunny Ri Li</a>. During this academic journey, my research delved into <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0437514" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Mixing gaseous hydrogen into natural gas distribution pipelines</a>, aligning with <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-and-climate-model/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-scenario-nze" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE)</a> initiative. The NZE Scenario charts a path for the global energy sector to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, with advanced economies leading the way. My contributions to this field have been acknowledged with notable accolades, including the Best Presentation Award at the Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering (CSME) International
Congress 2022 and the Best Paper Award at CSME 2023.

Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with Highest Distinction in Iran.
